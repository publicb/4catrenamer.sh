# 4catrenamer.sh

A shell script to rename image files downloaded from Instagram using 4CAT & Zeeschuimer (by @digitalmethodsinitiative) to a more human readable format.

## Description

Image files scraped from Instagram using 4CAT have cryptic file names:

```
152815837_2522634608039032_3786729139477127709_n.jpg
```

4catrenamer.sh renames the files to be more human readable:

```
20210228-122834-accountname-CL1f0NyF-C5.jpg
```

After renaming, the file names contain the post date and time, the name of the account and the unique post ID. The post ID (CL1f0NyF-C5) can be looked up on Instagram by going to https://www.instagram.com/p/CL1f0NyF-C5.

## Dependencies & Installing

The script is written in GNU bash, version 5.1.4.
No need for installing, just copy the script somewhere.
You will need the metadata csv file generated by 4CAT.

## Usage

The script takes two arguments: the directory containing the files to be renamed and the path to the metadata csv.

```
~/4catrenamer.sh ./targetdir ./metadata.csv
```

The original files are not touched. Instead, renamed copies are copied to ./targetdir/renamed/.
